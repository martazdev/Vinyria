# Can You Really Boost Your Energy in 20 Minutes? A Deep Dive into CircO2

In our 40s and 50s, many of us start to notice a slow "fading" of our natural vitality. We get tired earlier, our focus isn't as sharp, and our blood pressure starts to creep up. 

According to research, the hidden culprit often isn't just "old age"—it’s a dramatic decline in a "youth molecule" called **Nitric Oxide**. By the age of 70, your levels of this essential molecule can drop by as much as 75%.

Today, we’re reviewing **CircO2**, a supplement designed to jumpstart your Nitric Oxide levels in as little as 20 minutes.

## What is CircO2?

**CircO2** is a unique, fast-dissolving lozenge developed by Advanced Bionutritionals. Unlike traditional pills that get broken down by stomach acid, CircO2 is designed to work with the bacteria in your mouth to trigger immediate Nitric Oxide production.

### Key Benefits Reported by Users:
* **Rapid Energy Boost:** Increases stamina without caffeine jitters.
* **Sharper Mental Clarity:** Helps reduce "brain fog" and memory lapses.
* **Circulatory Support:** Promotes healthy blood pressure and better blood flow.
* **Enhanced Performance:** Supports physical activity and intimacy.

## Why Most Nitric Oxide Supplements Fail

Many people try to boost Nitric Oxide using **L-arginine** capsules or beet juice. While these aren't "bad," they have limitations:

1. **L-arginine** often loses 75% of its potency during digestion.
2. **Stomach Acid** can destroy the very nutrients meant to help your blood vessels.

**The MIT Breakthrough:** Scientists found that Nitric Oxide production actually starts on the *tongue*. By using a lozenge, CircO2 bypasses the digestive "trap" and gets straight to work.

## The Powerhouse Ingredients

CircO2 combines several scientifically-backed nutrients to maximize its effect:

| Ingredient | Primary Benefit |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Beet Root Powder** | Rich in natural nitrates for stamina. |
| **Hawthorn Berry** | Traditionally used to support heart health and absorption. |
| **L-Citrulline** | Converts to Nitric Oxide more effectively than Arginine. |
| **Vitamin B12 & C** | Boosts energy and protects cells from oxidative stress. |
| **Magnesium** | Helps relax blood vessels and regulates heart rhythm. |
