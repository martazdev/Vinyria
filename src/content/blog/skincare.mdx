## What is the Facial-X7?
The Facial-X7 is a next-generation LED facial mask that uses specific wavelengths of light to penetrate the skin at various depths. Unlike traditional treatments that can be abrasive or involve harsh chemicals, LED therapy is:
* **Non-invasive**
* **Painless**
* **Zero downtime required**

## 7 Colors, 7 Solutions
The "X7" in the name refers to the seven different light treatments packed into one sleek device. Each color targets a unique skin concern:

| Color | Primary Benefit | Best For |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Red Light** | Anti-aging | Collagen production & firming sagging skin. |
| **Blue Light** | Acne defense | Targeting bacteria & preventing new blemishes. |
| **Green Light** | Balancing | Evening skin tone & calming redness. |
| **Yellow Light** | Revitalizing | Improving oxygen exchange & reducing pigmentation. |
| **Purple Light** | Dual-Action | Combining red and blue for healing and anti-aging. |
| **Cyan Light** | Energizing | Promoting metabolism for tired-looking skin. |
| **White Light** | Deep Penetration | Accelerating tissue metabolism & fine line repair. |

## Why This Version (V1.2 DG) Stands Out
The **V1.2 DG model** is designed with the modern user in mind. It is lightweight, wireless, and rechargeable, meaning you don’t have to be tethered to a wall outlet. You can wear it while checking emails, folding laundry, or—our favorite—simply relaxing on the couch.

### Key Features:
* **FDA-Cleared Technology:** Built with safety and efficacy as a priority.
* **Comfort-First Design:** Made from soft, medical-grade silicone that contours to your face.
* **Eye Protection:** Integrated silicone goggles protect your eyes from the bright LED bulbs.
* **Cost-Efficient:** A one-time investment that replaces dozens of expensive spa visits.

## How to Use It for Best Results
Consistency is key with light therapy. For the best transformation, follow these steps:

1.  **Cleanse First:** Always start with a fresh, makeup-free face.
2.  **10 Minutes a Day:** Most users see visible results in as little as 4 weeks by using the mask for just 10 minutes daily.
3.  **Layer Your Serums:** After your session, your skin is primed to absorb products. Apply your favorite hyaluronic acid or Vitamin C serum immediately after for a "turbo-boosted" glow.
